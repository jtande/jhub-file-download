    "## What is TensorFlow?\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is **Google's second machine learning framework** for designing, building, and training deep learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why to use TensorFlow?\n",
    "\n",
    "The TensorFlow library may be used to perform numerical computations, which may not appear to be particularly noteworthy in and of itself, but these computations are carried out using data flow graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where in the real world we use TensorFLow?\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is widely used across the world by **Data scientists**. <br/>\n",
    "This is an open-source deep learning and machine learning library that has applications in text-based applications, image recognition, voice search, and many other areas. TensorFlow is used for image identification in DeepFace, **Facebook's image recognition** technology. **Apple's Siri** uses it for **voice recognition**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use Tensor flow?\t\t\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to import:Import tensorflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build a neural network that classifies images.\n",
    "2. Train this neural network.\n",
    "3. And, finally, evaluate the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where can we use the basic TensorFlow concepts?\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow can be used in several aspects where you can apply machine learning techniques. Some of the basic concepts are:\n",
    "- Image classification\n",
    "- Text classification\n",
    "- Text classification with TFhub\n",
    "- Over fitting\n",
    "- Under fitting \n",
    "- Creating Hyper parameters\n",

    "\n",
    "This is the simple example of using TensorFlow in an application, where the classifier can easily distinguish between regular emails and spam emails.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Preprocessing data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start using TensorFlow, these are the important basic libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loading the images using PIL library\n",
    "- CSV library\n",
    "- NumPy arrays library\n",
    "- Pandas Data-Frame library\n",
    "\n",
    "## Case studies\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using TensorFLow to categorize images and recognize objects at scale, Airbnb enhances the visitor experience.\n",
    "- GE Healthcare is using TensorFlow to train a neural network to detect specific anatomy during brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) tests in order to enhance speed and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
