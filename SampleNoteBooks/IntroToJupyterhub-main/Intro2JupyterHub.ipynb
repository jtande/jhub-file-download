    "**4 subsystems make up Jupyter Hub!**\n",
    "1. A Hub\n",
    "2. A configurable http proxy\n",

    "## How does the subsystems help?\n",
    "1. The Hub launches a proxy.\n",
    "2. The proxy forwards all requests to the Hub by default.\n",
    "3. The Hub handles user login and spawns single-user servers on demand.\n",
    "4. The Hub configures the proxy to forward URL prefixes to the single-user notebook servers.\n",

    "Along with the pros, there are cons associated with jupyterhub. Once you download the libraries required for your project, they are only valid for that session. Which means, you may have to redownload the libraries every time you log in to the website.\n",
